You quickly approach Home Depot, as running at hyper-sonic speeds is something natural for a Home Depot veteran. \n \"Hey Kid.\" \n Says someone behind the door, but it isn't Dream. Who could it be? You walk forward, ever so slightly, and ELMO comes dashing towards you. \n FIGHT! Which Weapon will you pick up? \n Sword \n Bow \n Wand.""")
